### Gesture Update
A thumbs-up with the right hand can now take a screenshot. 
Clenching your fist will generate an idea.

## Palm Menu Update
The output will be on your left-hand menu

## Potential needed improvements
[âœ…] Prevent too much text from being displayed    
[ ] Update prompt to make AI response better   
[ ] Too sensitive gesture recognition (It's easy to trigger some actions unintentionally)   
[ ] Redundant UI elements should be removed   

## Next Steps
TBD
